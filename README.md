# Homework 4: Online Banking System
This assignment is designed to give you practice writing code and applying lessons and topics for the current module.

This homework deals with the following topics:

- File I/O

- Dictionaries

The Assignment

In this assignment, you will implement an online banking system.  Users can sign-up with the system, log in to the system, change their password, and delete their account.  They can also update their bank account balance and transfer money to another user’s bank account.

You’ll implement functions related to File I/O and dictionaries.  The first two functions require you to import files and create dictionaries.  User information will be imported from the “users.txt” file and account information will be imported from the “bank.txt” file.  Take a look at the content in the different files.  The remaining functions require you to use or modify the two dictionaries created from the files.  

Each function has been defined for you, but without the code. See the docstring in each function for instructions on what the function is supposed to do and how to write the code. It should be clear enough.  In some cases, we have provided hints to help you get started.
